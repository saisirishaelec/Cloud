### Support for NTLM/Negotiate on both windows and linux

This release makes no changes to the command line interface, but users should now be aware that Negotiate authentication and encryption over plaintext HTTP now works on linux in addition to windows.

Users who use knife-windows to bootstrap nodes over plaintext HTTP should also be aware that they no longer need, and in fact should not, configure base images enabling `basic_auth` or enabling `AllowUnencrypted` in their winrm configuration.
